        <h1 style="margin-left:10px">PROS OF ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
        <p style="margin-left:10px">
            Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer program to
            learn and think. Everything can be considered Artificial
            intelligence if it involves a program doing something that we would
            normally think would rely on the intelligence of a human.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:10px">Some of the advantages of AI are:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left:10px">
            <li>
                <b>Reduction in Human Error:</b><br />
                The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes
                from time to time. Computers, however, do not make these
                mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial
                intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously
                gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms. So
                errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a
                greater degree of precision is a possibility. Example: In
                Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of
                human error.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <b>Takes risks instead of Humans:</b><br />
                This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial
                intelligence. We can overcome many risky limitations of humans
                by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things
                for us. Let it be going to mars, defuse a bomb, explore the
                deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil, it can be used
                effectively in any kind of natural or man-made disasters.
                Example: Have you heard about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
                explosion in Ukraine? At that time there were no AI-powered
                robots that can help us to minimize the effect of radiation by
                controlling the fire in early stages, as any human went close to
                the core was dead in a matter of minutes. They eventually poured
                sand and boron from helicopters from a mere distance. AI Robots
                can be used in such situations where intervention can be
                hazardous.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <b>Available 24x7:</b><br />
                An Average human will work for 4–6 hours a day excluding the
                breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for
                refreshing themselves and get ready for a new day of work and
                they even have weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life
                and personal life. But using AI we can make machines work 24x7
                without any breaks and they don’t even get bored, unlike humans.
                Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting
                many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using
                AI.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Helping in Repetitive Jobs: </b><br>In our day-to-day work, we
                will be performing many repetitive works like sending a thanking
                mail, verifying certain documents for errors and many more
                things. Using artificial intelligence we can productively
                automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks
                for humans and free them up to be increasingly creative.
                Example: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents
                to get a loan which is a repetitive task for the owner of the
                bank. Using AI Cognitive Automation the owner can speed up the
                process of verifying the documents by which both the customers
                and the owner will be benefited.</li>
            <li><b>Digital Assistance: </b>Some of
                the highly advanced organizations use digital assistants to
                interact with users which saves the need for human resources.
                The digital assistants also used in many websites to provide
                things that users want. We can chat with them about what we are
                looking for. Some chatbots are designed in such a way that it’s
                become hard to determine that we’re chatting with a chatbot or a
                human being. Example: We all know that organizations have a
                customer support team that needs to clarify the doubts and
                queries of the customers. Using AI the organizations can set up
                a Voice bot or Chatbot which can help customers with all their
                queries. We can see many organizations already started using
                them on their websites and mobile applications. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Faster Decisions:</b><br> Using AI alongside other technologies we can make
                machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out
                actions quicker. While taking a decision human will analyze many
                factors both emotionally and practically but AI-powered machine
                works on what it is programmed and delivers the results in a
                faster way. Example: We all have played Chess games in Windows.
                It is nearly impossible to beat CPU in the hard mode because of
                the AI behind that game. It will take the best possible step in
                a very short time according to the algorithms used behind it.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> <b> Daily Applications:</b> <br>Daily applications such as Apple’s Siri,
                Window’s Cortana, Google’s OK Google are frequently used in our
                daily routine whether it is for searching a location, taking a
                selfie, making a phone call, replying to a mail and many more.
                Example: Around 20 years ago, when we are planning to go
                somewhere we used to ask a person who already went there for the
                directions. But now all we have to do is say “OK Google where is
                Visakhapatnam”. It will show you Visakhapatnam’s location on
                google map and the best path between you and Visakhapatnam.</li><br>
            <li><b>
                New Inventions:</b> AI is powering many inventions in almost every
                domain which will help humans solve the majority of complex
                problems. Example: Recently doctors can predict breast cancer in
                the woman at earlier stages using advanced AI-based
                technologies.</li>
