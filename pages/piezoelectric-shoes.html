				The research of wearable energy harvesting and storage devices
				has attracted tremendous attention from researchers with
				commercial wearable devices emerging in the life as new
				mainstream. Among them, shoes are a better choice for energy
				harvesting. However, most of the existing energy harvesting and
				storage shoes have complex structures, poor wearing comfort, and
				high cost. In order to solve these problems, a kind of
				innovative multi-functional shoes is developed and discussed in
				this paper. The shoe contain two main parts. One is a rubber
				column used as heel material, which plays a role in cushioning
				and damping during movement and making the shoe more comfortable
				to wear. The other one is a circuit system designed to realize
				energy harvesting, energy storage, and emergency charging of
				electronic products during walking. The performance test of the
				rubber column is carried out, and then the structure and
				geometric size of the rubber column is optimized according to
				its performance, human weight, and gait. Finally, the stress and
				energy harvesting of the multi-functional shoes in different
				gait conditions are analyzed. The analysis results show that the
				developed innovative multi-functional shoe has good stability
				and versatility when working under different gait, and the
				rubber column is beneficial to improve the wearing comfort of
				energy harvesting shoes.

				Design on Innovative Multi-Functional Shoes
			</h2>

			<p>
				The main function of innovative multi-functional shoes is to
				collect electric energy continuously during people's walking
				process, and at the same time to ensure the comfort of people
				walking. In order to achieve these functions, the
				multi-functional shoe mainly consists of the rubber column and
				the power acquisition device which consists of a linear
				generator, a storage circuit and a charging interface, as shown
				in Figure 1. At the heel of the shoe, a ring shaped rubber
				column is placed inside. And a linear generator is placed at the
				center of the ring. The solid insole is placed above the rubber
				column and is directly connected to the rubber column and the
				movable part of the linear generator.

			<i>
				The insoles can be manufactured according to individual’s ground
				pressure foot print for increasing the comfort and the output in
				each step. The people who are in constant travel need a
				trustable energy source to charge their devices. This invention
				can prove very useful to the ones who are in remote areas like a
				village in third world country or in a forest. The present
				invention has it applications in space industry as it don’t have
				any moving part and is light in weight unlike other systems of
				prior art. It will be very effective if someone is on planet
				mars and need to charge his suits. Well Peizo-electric shoes
				have a variety of applications in today’s modern world.
