						Artificial Intelligence is a software that is
						intelligent enough to perform complex tasks on its own
						without requiring any assistance from humans.
						<br /><br />

						A formal definition of AI would be: <br /><br />
						<blockquote class="blockquote">
							<p>
								The theory and development of computer systems
								able to perform tasks normally requiring human
								intelligence, such as visual perception, speech
								recognition, decision-making, and translation
								between languages.
							</p>
						</blockquote>

						Artificial Intelligence is believed to be the technology
						of the future that can combat numerous problems in a
						variety of fields ranging from robotics, medical
						sciences, logistics and transportation, finances, and
						tons more utility services in industries.

						Initially, AI was not as successful as we thought due to
						low computational power and data we had access too.
						<br /><br />

						Nowadays, we have both high computational powers thanks
						to graphical proccessing units and high amounts of data
						to allow ai to study on. <br /><br />

						As of right now, AI is quite powerful to solve a set of
						tasks that is assigned to it efficiently and
						effectively. However, it hasnâ€™t reached its peak yet,
						and we are a few years, possibly decades away from that

						Most likely, no. During the industrial revolution,

						Artificial Narrow Intelligence is a type of AI which can
						only accomplish a single, but complex task without human
						help. For example, an AI which can drive on it's own is
						an ANI. Another example would be AI which can classify
						different fruits and vegetables. <br /><br />

						Artificial General Intelligence is a type of AI which
						can perform multiple complex tasks on its own without
						human support. For example, an AI which can act as a
						normal human, who can do multiple tasks exactly like a
						human, is considered an AGI. <br /><br />

						Currently, we are very far from developing AGIs and can
						only develop ANIs

						Well, no. AI isn't very hard to understand. <br /><br />

						It's an field containing lots of other sub fields. It's
						totally worth investing your precious time to gain
						further knowledge about AI if you are particularly
						interested in the various intriguing concepts that are
						offered by the following subject.
						<br /><br />

						While learning AI from scratch might sometimes be hard
						at the beginning, it becomes more interesting and cool
						as you proceed to invest more time learning numerous
						concepts related to AI. <br /><br />

						You will gain exposure to mathematics, programming,
						machine learning, and so much more that will expand your
						vast knowledge. <br /><br />

						The best part about getting your hands wet with
						Artificial Intelligence is that the knowledge you gain
						from the following subject can be partially or
						completely utilized for various software applications
						and jobs as well.
