				How Piezoelectricity Works to Make Crystals Conduct Electric
				Current
			</h2>
			<p>
				Piezo what? It sounds like a lot to take in, but it’s simple to
				understand. The word piezoelectric originates from the Greek
				word piezein, which literally means to squeeze or press. Instead
				of squeezing grapes to make wine, we’re squeezing crystals to
				make an electric current! Piezoelectricity is found in a ton of
				everyday electronic devices, from quartz watches to speakers and
				microphones. In a nutshell:
			</p>

			<p>
				<b
					>Piezoelectricity is the process of using crystals to
					convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, or vice
					versa.</b
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				Regular crystals are defined by their organized and repeating
				structure of atoms that are held together by bonds, this is
				called a unit cell. Most crystals, such as iron have a
				symmetrical unit cell, which makes them useless for
				piezoelectric purposes.

			<p>
				There are other crystals that get lumped together as
				piezoelectric materials. The structure in these crystals aren’t
				symmetrical but they still exist in an electrically neutral
				balance. However, if you apply mechanical pressure to a
				piezoelectric crystal, the structure deforms, atoms get pushed
				around, and suddenly you have a crystal that can conduct an
				electrical current. If you take the same piezoelectric crystal
				and apply an electric current to it, the crystal will expand and
				contract, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy.
			</p>

			<h2 class="greyTitle">Types of Piezoelectric Materials</h2>
			<p>
				There are a variety of piezoelectric materials that can conduct
				an electric current, both man-made and natural. The most well
				known, and the first piezoelectric material used in electronic
				devices is the quartz crystal. Other naturally occurring
				piezoelectric materials include cane sugar, Rochelle salt,
				topaz, tourmaline, and even bone.
			</p>
			<b>Quartz-crystal</b>

			<p>
				As piezoelectric technology started to take off after World War
				I we began developing man-made materials to rival the
				performance of quartz. Man-made piezoelectric materials include:
			</p>
			<p>
				PZT is made from lead zirconate titanate and can produce more
				voltage than quartz with the same amount of mechanical pressure.
			</p>
			<b>PZT-piezo-ceramics</b>

			<p>PZT piezo ceramics used in ultrasonic sensors.</p>

			<b>Barium Titanate.</b>
			<p>
				Barium Titanate is a ceramic piezoelectric material that was
				discovered during World War II and is known for its long lasting
				durability.
			</p>
			<b>Lithium Niobate</b>
			<p>
				Lithium Niobate is a material that combines oxygen, lithium, and
				nobium together in a ceramic material that performs similar to
				barium titanate.
			</p>
			<h3>How Piezoelectricity Works</h3>
			<p>
				We have specific materials that are suited for piezoelectricity
				applications, but how exactly does the process work? With the
				Piezoelectric Effect. The most unique trait of this effect is
				that it works two ways. You can apply mechanical energy or
				electrical energy to the same piezoelectric material and get an
				opposite result.
			</p>
			<p>
				Applying mechanical energy to a crystal is called a direct
				piezoelectric effect and works like this:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A piezoelectric crystal is placed between two metal plates.
					At this point the material is in perfect balance and does
					not conduct an electric current.
				</li>
				<li>
					Mechanical pressure is then applied to the material by the
					metal plates, which forces the electric charges within the
					crystal out of balance. Excess negative and positive charges
					appear on opposite sides of the crystal face.
				</li>
				<li>
					The metal plate collects these charges, which can be used to
					produce a voltage and send an electrical current through a
					circuit.
				</li>
			</ol>

				>IMAGE SOURCE</a
			>
			<br />
			<p>
				That’s it, a simple application of mechanical pressure, the
				squeezing of a crystal and suddenly you have an electric
				current. You can also do the opposite, applying an electrical
				signal to a material as an inverse piezoelectric effect. It
				works like this:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In the same situation as the example above, we have a
					piezoelectric crystal placed between two metal plates. The
					crystal’s structure is in perfect balance.
				</li>
				<li>
					Electrical energy is then applied to the crystal, which
					shrinks and expands the crystal’s structure.
				</li>
				<li>
					As the crystal’s structure expands and contracts, it
					converts the received electrical energy and releases
					mechanical energy in the form of a sound wave.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The inverse piezoelectric effect is used in a variety of
				applications. Take a speaker for example, which applies a
				voltage to a piezoelectric ceramic, causing the material to
				vibrate the air as sound waves.
