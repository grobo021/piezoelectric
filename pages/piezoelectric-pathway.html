            <h2 class="greyTitle">Green energy harvesting from human footsteps</h2>
           <p>A sustainable green energy needs is increasing.
            Meanwhile the energy itself is not always available
            compare to the needs according to its sources. According
            to Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources data on
            their twitter account by April 7th 2018,consumable electricity reached around 1,128
            KWh/Capita as per 2018. Meanwhile, the use of
            renewable energy source still as low as 12,15% compare
            to fuel and fossil sources. This will increase as many
            electric appliances usage keep grow exponentially.
            Energy and Mineral Resources.</p>
            </p>One of the most rapid activities in normal human life
            is footstepping. Either walking, jogging, running or
            dancing footsteps activities needs a lot of energy and
            residues into body heat or sweats.
            This potential waste energy can be recycle into another
            form of usable energy.</p>
           
            <p>Piezoelectric floors generate many microwatts up to
            many watts per step, depending on pedestriansâ€™s
            frequency and piezoelectric technology. Several
            feasibility studies has been proposed, such as
            high pedestrian public space and low pedestrian private
            space. Another report shows that piezoelectric
            pavement can also be design for intelligent road and all
            kind of information board, light, etc. All of this
            possibility begin with scavenging the human activities.</p>
          
            <p>Another application of piezoelectric energy harvester
            found. The idea still using piezoelectricity
            phenomenon when it got pressed or vibrated by
            raindrops, vibration, pavement pressure, highway
            pressure etc.</p>
