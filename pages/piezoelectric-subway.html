			<p>
				Today, energy resources are very important for everyday life,
				transportation and industry. Energy is especially critical for
				transport investments. Energy resources in the world are limited
				and the existing reserves are decreasing day by day. Due to this
				decrease, the use of renewable energy sources is more preferred.
				Especially with the developing technology, new renewable energy
				production systems are designed. Piezoelectric energy, which is
				one of the renewable energy systems, is up to date. Motion
				energy is converted into electrical energy with
				pieozeelelectric. In and out of the vehicle in the subway system
				and exit from the station with the station landing and boarding
				route there is considerable movement energy potential as there
				is intense passenger movement throughout.
			</p>
			

			<p>
				The United Nations estimates that, by 2050, two thirds of the
				world’s population will live in cities. As a result of this
				growing population, the demand for energy will increase
				dramatically. We have already seen several innovative approaches
				to this problem, such as using empty mine shafts to help
				generate electricity and fish-friendly hydropower. Now, British
				start-up Moya Power has come up with a novel approach – using
				the wind in train tunnels to generate electricity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Moya Power uses piezo-electric textiles – fabrics that generate
				electricity in response to movement or pressure. These textiles
				have slivers of bendable filaments embedded in them which are
				moved by gusts of air and vibrations. The energy produced is
				then stored in a battery. Tests indicate that the sheets
				generate just 10 percent of the energy, per square meter, of a
				solar panel. However, the piezoelectric sheets have the
				advantage that they can be installed in areas where solar panels
				will not work. For example, under bridges or indoors, taking
				advantage of urban spaces that would otherwise be wasted. As
				part of a pilot project, Moya is installing grids of the plastic
				sheets in tunnels on London Crossrail routes. Drafts in the
				tunnels cause the sheets to wave and flutter, generating
				electricity.
			</p>

			<p>
				The company suggests that, in the future, the sheets could be
				mounted on a range of surfaces. For instance, the sides of
				skyscrapers and along railways, making use of the windiest parts
				of the city. Says Moya’s founder Charlotte Slingsby, “I wanted
				to create something that works in different situations and that
				can be flexibly adapted, whether you live in an urban hut or a
				high-rise.” Although the yield from the sheeting is low, Sligsby
				sees Moya as one element in powering cities from a mixture of
				energy sources. What other unused places in a city could be used
				to generate small amounts of electricity?
