			Artificial Intelligence has been playing a robust and growing role
			in the world the past few decades.

			<strong>
				One major area AI is growing rapidly is the medical field;
				specifically, in diagnostics and treatment management. As there
				is a fear of Artificial Intelligence surpassing human tasks and
				ability, there is significant research as to how AI can aid in
				clinical decisions, support human judgement and increase
				treatment efficiency.
			</strong>
			<br /><br />

			There are various magnitudes of AI in healthcare. Many times, AI
			utilizes a web database allowing doctors and practitioners to access
			thousands of diagnostic resources. As doctors have been deeply
			educated in their field and are current with present research, the
			use of AI greatly increases a faster outcome that can be matched
			with their clinical knowledge. Artificial Intelligence presents many
			fears, especially in the clinical setting, of eventually replacing
			or reducing the need for human physicians. However, recent research
			and data has shown that it is more likely this tool will benefit and
			enhance clinical diagnostics and decision making rather than reduce
			clinician need. <br /><br />

			Many times, a patient can present multiple symptoms that can
			correlate with various conditions by both genetic and physical
			characteristics, which can delay a diagnosis. So, not only does AI
			benefit a practitioner in terms of efficiency, it provides both
			quantitative and qualitative data based on input feedback, improving
			accuracy in early detection, diagnosis, treatment plan and an
			outcome prediction. <br /><br />

			The ability for AI to “learn” from the data provides the opportunity
			for improved accuracy based on feedback responses. This feedback
			includes many back-end database sources, input from practitioners,
			doctors, and research institutions. The AI systems in healthcare are
			always working in real time, which means the data is always
			updating, thus increasing accuracy and relevance. Assembled data is
			a compilation of different medical notes, electronic recordings from
			medical devices, laboratory images, physical examinations and
			various demographics. With this compilation of endlessly updating
			information, practitioners have almost unlimited resources to
			improve their treatment capabilities. <br /><br />

			<h1>AI Machine Learning Provides More Targeted Diagnostics</h1>
			<br />
			With various amounts of healthcare data out in the field, Artificial
			Intelligence must efficiently sort through the presented data in
			order to “learn” and build a network. Within the realm of healthcare
			data there are two different types of data that can be sorted;
			unstructured and structured. Structured learning includes three
			different types of techniques including Machine Learning Techniques
			(ML), a Neural Network system, and Modern Deep Learning. Whereas,
			all unstructured data uses Natural Language Processing (NLP).
			<br /><br />

			Machine Learning techniques use analytical algorithms in order to
			pull out specific patient traits, which include all the information
			that would be collected in a patient visit with a practitioner.
			These traits, such as physical exam results, medications, symptoms,
			basic metrics, disease specific data, diagnostic imaging, gene
			expressions, and different laboratory testing all contribute to the
			collected structured data. Through machine learning, patient
			outcomes can then be determined. In one study, Neural Networking was
			utilized in a breast cancer diagnostic process sorting from 6,567
			genes and paired with texture information inputted from the
			subjects’ mammograms. This combination of logged genetic and
			physical characteristics allowed for a more specific tumor indicator
			outcome. <br /><br />

			The most common type of Machine Learning in a clinical setting is
			known as supervised learning. Supervised learning uses the physical
			traits of the patient, backed with a database of information (in
			this case breast cancer genes), to provide a more targeted outcome.
			Another type of learning used is Modern Deep Learning, which is
			considered to go beyond the surface of Machine Learning. Deep
			Learning takes the same inputs as Machine Learning, but feeds it
			into a computerized neural network; a hidden layer that further
			files the information to a more simplified output. This helps aid
			practitioners that may have multiple possible diagnoses narrow down
			to one or two outcomes; thus, allowing the practitioner to make a
			more definitive and concrete conclusion. <br /><br />

			Similar to the structured data processes is Natural Language
			Processing, which focuses on all of the unstructured data in a
			clinical setting. This type of data is from clinical notes and
			documented speech to text processing when a practitioner sees a
			patient. This data includes narratives from physical examinations,
			laboratory reports, and exam summaries. The Natural Language
			Processing uses historical databases that have disease relevant
			keywords aiding in the decision-making process for a diagnosis.
			Using these processes can provide a more accurate and efficient
			diagnosis for a patient, which in turn saves time for the
			practitioner, and more importantly can speed up the treatment
			process. The faster, more targeted and specific the diagnosis, the
			sooner a patient can be on the road to recovery. <br /><br />

			<h1>Artificial Intelligence Integrated in Major Disease Areas</h1>
			<br />
			With cardiovascular, neurological disorders and cancer consistently
			being the top causes of death, it is imperative that as many
			resources as possible are being utilized to aid in early detection,
			diagnosis and treatment. The implementation of artificial
			intelligence provides benefits in early detection by being able to
			pinpoint any risk alerts a patient may have. <br /><br />

			One study involving patients at risk for stroke used AI algorithms
			based on their presented symptoms and genetic history to place them
			in an early detection stage. This stage was movement based, where
			any abnormal physical movement in the patient was documented and
			would trigger an alert. This trigger alert allowed for practitioners
			to get patients to a MRI/CT scan sooner for a disease evaluation. In
			the study, the early detection alert provided 87.6% accuracy in a
			diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. That said, the practitioners
			were able to implement treatment sooner and predict whether the
			patient had a higher possibility of future stroke. Likewise, machine
			learning was used in 48-hour post-stroke patients gaining a
			perdition accuracy of 70% whether the patient may have another
			stroke or not. <br /><br />

			<h1>Telehealth: Artificial Intelligence on a Smaller Scale</h1>
			<br />
			Although Artificial Intelligence is used for high-risk diseases and
			on a larger scale, telehealth tools are being implemented into homes
			of patients to help treat and prevent high-risk situations while
			reducing hospital readmissions. Telehealth tools allow for different
			metrics to be taken, documented and processed much like a more
			expansive AI machine. This equipment can notify practitioners
			immediately when a patient reports a high-risk variable. Early
			detection, faster diagnostics, and an updated treatment plan, reduce
			time and money for both the patient and hospital, while getting more
			immediate care. Artificial Intelligence is allowing practitioners to
			make more efficient and logical decisions, bettering the care for
			patients as a whole; which in the end, is the ultimate goal.
