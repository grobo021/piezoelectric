				Generate Electricity While You Groove On The Dance Floor
			</h2>
			<p>
				A number of places and companies have already tried to install
				piezoelectric floors to harness energy in this way. The best
				example is Club Surya in London. It intends to build a
				completely green club that meets most of its energy requirements
				using alternative methods of producing electricity. With that in
				mind, and given that it is a popular place to groove,
				piezoelectric dance floors are the main feature of its green
				strategy. On a particularly packed night, this club can meet as
				much as 60% of its energy requirements by using this method.
				There are a few other examples of organizations and venues that
				have tried to implement this cutting-edge tech, but there are
				certain issues to consider. The cost of installation of the
				necessary equipment is quite high and the amount of power
				produced in a day is not great. Even so, who knowsâ€¦ in the
				coming years, we may have better technologies to support this
				method of harnessing energy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Club Surya in London is one of a new generation of "eco-clubs"
				which encourages its patrons to work towards climate change. The
				club's main feature is the piezoelectric dance floor.
			</p>

			<p>
				The dance floor uses piezoelectricity where crystal and ceramics
				create a charge to generate electricity. The nightclub has a
				"bouncing" floor made of springs and a series of power
				generating blocks which produce a small electrical current when
				squashed. As dancers move the floor up and down to squeeze the
				blocks, the current is fed into nearby batteries which are
				constantly recharged by the movement of the floor. The
				electricity created in this way is used to power parts of the
				nightclub such as the sound and lighting.
			</p>

			<p>
				The owner and developer of Club Surya, Andrew Charalambous,
				estimates that a full dance floor could provide 60% of the
				club's energy needs. The club also has its own wind turbine and
				solar energy system. Mr Charalambous hopes to inspire young
				people to combat global warming.
			</p>

			<p>
				In Rotterdam, Club Watt also houses an energy harvesting dance
				floor which generates power for the clubs' lights, the average
				dancer making around 20 watts of electricity. That electricity
				is used to power the light show in and around the floor. "For
				this first club, we thought it was useful for people to see the
				results," said Michel Smit, an adviser on the project. "But if
				the next owner wants to use the electricity to power his
				toaster, it can do that just as well." The dance floor is loaned
				out for demonstrations and the club also has rainwater-fed
				toilets and low-waste bars where almost everything is recycled.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the first nightclubs to use this energy harvesting floor
				technology was the Sustainable Dance Club in the Netherlands.
				Created by Enviu, an environmental organisation, together with
				Dutch architectural firm Doll the club opened in October 2008.
				The dance floor is a fusion of electronics, embedded software
				and smart durable materials. It consists of modules measuring 65
				x 65 cm, each of which makes a vertical movement of up to about
				1 cm when danced on. These movements are transformed by an
				advanced electric motor into electric power. Every person is
				able to produce 5-20 Watts of power, depending on his or her
				weight and activity on the dance floor.The generated energy is
				then used to power the interactive elements of the floor. The
				technology of the dance floor is continuously being developed so
				that it is possible to use the generated energy for wider uses.
			</p>

			<p>
				In order to spread the sustainable message to a wider audience,
				the Sustainable Dance Club recently displayed their dance floor
				at the Australian Museum in Sydney.
			</p>

			<p>
				This technology has many applications for the generation of
				electricity from the movement of people inlcuding pedestrian
				traffic in urban spaces, to vehicular traffic on roads.
