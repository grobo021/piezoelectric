			<h1 class="greyTitle">PIEZOELECTRIC ROADS</h1>
			The roads which produce electricity by application of mechanical
			energy when vehicle moves over the road, those roads are called as
			piezoelectric roads. These roads are having a piezoelectric sensor
			within them to produce electricity.<br /><br />

			<h1 class="greyTitle">CONSTRUCTION OF PIEZOELECTRIC ROADS</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The first layer is laid with fine gravel and sand content.
				</li>
				<li>
					Then a thin layer of asphalt is laid which acts like a
					strong base for the generators.
				</li>
				<li>
					Piezoelectric generators are placed in quick drying concrete
					as per design and left for 30 min.
				</li>

				<li>
					Then all the generators are wired in series to get
					collective output.
				</li>
				<li>
					A bitumen sheet is used to cover all the generators to
					provide better adhesion of concrete to asphalt.
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally a thick layer of asphalt is laid which finishes the
					construction.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 class="greyTitle">HARVESTING MECHANISM</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Generators harvest the mechanical energy of the vehicles and
					convert to electrical energy.
				</li>
				<li>
					Electric energy is transferred and stored via harvesting
					module. Then it is charged into the battery on one side of
					the road.
				</li>

				<li>From there it is distributed.</li>
				<li>
					Yield: For 1 km of piezoelectric road of one lane we can
					generate 44000KWh per year
				</li>
			</ul>

				PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF PIEZOELECTRIC ROADS
			</h1>
			<p>
				The piezoelectric energy generating roads have been proposed in
				the car capital of the world, California. The design is based on
				piezoelectricity that is produced in response to mechanical
				stress applied on some solid materials like crystals and some
				ceramics. The design proposes the placement of piezoelectric
				sensor beneath the road surface which would produce electricity
				from the vibration of caused by movement of vehicles on road.
				When applied on road, the piezoelectric technology could produce
				up to 44 megawatts of electricity per year from one kilometre
				stretch of the road and meet the energy demand of about 30,800
				households.

			<h1 class="greyTitle">PRINCIPLE OF WORKING</h1>
			<p>The basic principle which we use to generate electricity is the
			piezoelectric effect. A piezoelectric material is that one which
			converts mechanical energy or vibration energy that is experienced
			on it, to a charge which can be stored. When a force or pressure is
			exerted on the elastic piezoelectric crystal material, the crystal
			gets deformed and this causes it to develop charge between them and
			the crystal goes back to its original state. This charge flow is
			converted to a voltage that can be stored in a battery. We explain
			about a disc shaped piezoelectric buffer plate in our paper. Since
			the power obtained from a few of them will be in a very small
			amount, we use voltage amplifying circuits here. As the size and
			number of piezoelectric crystals increase, the energy obtained from
			them also increases. street light is controlled automatically by
			Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs). With the help of LDRs the street
			lights are automatically switched off during day time and switched
			off during night time. The automatic traffic light control is made
			possible by two pair of IR transceivers placed on each road of the
			four-way junction. Each transceiver pairs are kept face to face
			width-wise on each road. When the IR signals between each of the
			transmitter and receiver pair gets cut proportionally according to
			the traffic density on each road, the traffic lights are controlled.
			This function with the help of a program stored in a
			microcontroller. Besides all these, the charging condition of the
			battery is sent and indicated every second to the nearest traffic
			control room.</p>
