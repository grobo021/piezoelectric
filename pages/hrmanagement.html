				AI-based HR applications raise employee productivity. It has the
				ability to analyse, predict, diagnose and become a more capable
				resource while focusing on employee needs and outcomes.
			</strong>
			<br /><br />

			<strong>
				The influence of AI is expanding to a greater extent in human
				resource management.
			</strong>
			It starts from the recruitment process to the exit process of an
			employee that includes training, engagement, perks, records, and so
			forth. <br /><br />

			<h5>Personalized experience</h5>
			<br />
			The influence of AI is more felt in the talent acquisition processes
			like screening of prospective candidates, recording and maintaining
			the database, automating interview schedules, sending a message,
			answering job seekers’ queries, and more. It helps in preliminary
			mundane tasks. <br /><br />

			The results are significant, measurable, and immediate. It reduces
			the hiring time and increases productivity for HR professionals. The
			team is left with time for higher-value work like sourcing,
			recruitment marketing, employee engagement, and hiring managers.
			<br /><br />

			For instance, The Job Intelligence Maestro (JIM) for DBS Talent
			Acquisition Team reduced the screening time from 32 minutes to 8
			minutes per candidate. <br /><br />

			AI-backed programs introduce the new employee to job profile, new
			hire information like reporting authority, team members, task
			assignment, administrative tasks, policies, and almost all
			first-hand information through an app or laptop on his/her first
			day. <br /><br />

			<h5>Workforce management decisions</h5>
			<br />
			Some of the areas (apart from recruitment) where AI is creating an
			impact include HR strategy and employee management, analyse company
			policies and practices, manage payrolls, automate workforce,
			investigate corporate compliance, litigation strategy, analyse
			success, and other related programs. The technical-minded HR
			personnel can readily apply technology to HR functions, learning,
			and development applications. <br /><br />

			<h5>Smart people analytics</h5>
			<br />
			Leveraging big data tracks employee’s performance and sentiment as
			well. AI tracks the employees’ activities like browsing, emails,
			projects, and other tasks for a brief period. It can single out
			employees and report to administration. This helps the organization
			to improvise engagement and retention strategies.
