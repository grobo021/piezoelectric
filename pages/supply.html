				Logistics & Supply Chain

		<div class="mx-5 my-5">
			The modern supply chain is an intricate animal that incorporates
			many different organizations, people, processes and technologies.
			Add the word “global” to the equation, and those complexities become
			even more difficult to manage. Moreover, with disruptions like the
			global pandemic wreaking havoc on the world’s supply chains, the
			need to balance resiliency with profitability has become mandatory
			for most organizations. <br /><br />

			Fortunately,
			<strong>
				technology has advanced to the point where it can help
				organizations more effectively manage their global supply chains
				without the need for additional labor, physical space, or
				expertise.
			</strong>
			From predictive to prescriptive, from decision support to decision
			automation, artificial intelligence is transforming supply-chain
			activities in new ways. <br /><br />

			Performing tasks in a manner similar to human brains, AI-enabled
			technology can sense and respond to specific features within its
			environment. It can learn to solve problems such as delivery delays
			and weather-related disruptions in unexpected ways, recognizing the
			nuances of speech and exhibiting some form of humanlike creativity.
