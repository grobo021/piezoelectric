			<h1 style="margin-left: 10px">CONS OF ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
			<p>
				As every bright side has a darker version in it. Artificial
				Intelligence also has some disadvantages. Let’s see some of them
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>High Costs of Creation:</b>
					As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need
					to get updated with time to meet the latest requirements.
					Machines need repairing and maintenance which need plenty of
					costs. It’ s creation requires huge costs as they are very
					complex machines.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Making Humans Lazy:</b> AI is making humans lazy with its
					applications automating the majority of the work. Humans
					tend to get addicted to these inventions which can cause a
					problem to future generations.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Unemployment:</b>
					As AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and
					other works with robots,human interference is becoming less
					which will cause a major problem in the employment
					standards. Every organization is looking to replace the
					minimum qualified individuals with AI robots which can do
					similar work with more efficiency.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b> No Emotions:</b>
					There is no doubt that machines are much better when it
					comes to working efficiently but they cannot replace the
					human connection that makes the team. Machines cannot
					develop a bond with humans which is an essential attribute
					when comes to Team Management.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Lacking Out of Box Thinking:</b>
					Machines can perform only those tasks which they are
					designed or programmed to do, anything out of that they tend
					to crash or give irrelevant outputs which could be a major
					backdrop.
				</li>
			</ul>

					<div class="desc">
						Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system and a driver
						who relied too heavily on it are likely to blame for a
						2018 crash in California in which the driver died, a
						federal safety agency said.
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="gallery">
					<img src="../images/adverse/cyborg.jpg" alt="" />
					<div class="desc">
						So-called adversarial AI attacks include bypassing AI
						systems, manipulating results, and exfiltrating the data
						that the model is based on.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="gallery">
					<img src="../images/adverse/alexa.jpg" alt="" />
					<div class="desc">
						Amazon’s Alexa is ‘laughing’ at night and scaring users.
						Several people took it to Twitter and Reddit where they
						said that they thought it was a laugh from an actual
						person somewhere nearby, which can be really spooky if
						you are the only person around.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="gallery">
					<img src="../images/adverse/fb.jpg" alt="" />
					<div class="desc">
						Researchers have shut down two Facebook artificial
						intelligence (AI) robots after they started
						communicating with each other in their own language. The
						robots, nicknamed Bob and Alice, were originally
						communicating in English, when they swapped to what
						initially appeared to be gibberish.

				<div class="gallery">
					<img src="../images/adverse/sophiya.jpg" alt="" />
					<div class="desc">
						The First 'Robot Citizen' in the World Once Said She
						Wants to 'Destroy Humans'. Sophia made the statement
						while sitting a few feet away from her human operator,
						ironically questioning human ability. She added that it
						is important to be kind and fair but humans often are
						unkind to each other.

				<div class="gallery">
					<img src="../images/adverse/drone.jpg" alt="" />
					<div class="desc">
						Two explosions that rocked an Indian Air Force station
						in the northern region of Jammu were attacks caused by
						explosives-laden drones and orchestrated by
						Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group,
						according to Indian police and ministry sources.

				<div class="gallery">
					<img src="../images/adverse/weapon.jpg" alt="" />
					<div class="desc">
						Weaponised AI features heavily in the security
						strategies of the US, China and Russia. And some
						existing weapons systems already include autonomous
						capabilities based on AI, developing weaponised AI
						further means machines could potentially make decisions
						to harm and kill people based on their programming,
						without human intervention.
