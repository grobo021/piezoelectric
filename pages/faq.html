							During vibration energy harvesting, piezoelectric
							materials convert mechanical strain into an
							electrical charge or voltage via the direct
							piezoelectric effect. Extrinsic factors comprise of
							the input vibration frequency, acceleration of the
							base/host structure, and the amplitude of the
							excitation.
						</p>

						<p>
							Environmental pollution has been one of the main
							challenges for sustainable development.
							Piezoelectric materials can be used as a means of
							transforming ambient vibrations into electrical
							energy to power devices. The focus is on an
							alternative approach to scavenge energy from the
							environment.
						</p>

						<p>
							Harvesting methodologies to evaluate the potential
							effectiveness of different techniques and provides
							an overview of the methods and challenges of
							harvesting energy using piezoelectric materials.
						</p>

						<p>
							Piezoelectric energy harvesters have many
							applications, including sensor nodes, wireless
							communication, microelectromechanical systems,
							handheld devices, and mobile devices.
						</p>

						<p>
							Piezoelectric energy harvesting also uses the impact
							of raindrops. The energy harvesting model presented
							is further analyzed for single-unit harvester and an
							array of multiple harvesters to maximize the
							efficiency of the device.

						No. Applying pressure to a piezoelectric material
						generates charges on its surface. In this state, the
						piezoelectric element behaves very much like a charged
						capacitor. It will discharge when connected to a load,
						in a couple of milliseconds. In order to keep on
						extracting electrical energy, one has to constantly
						re-apply pressure to the material, that is, to make it
						vibrate. This is why people spend time developing
						piezoelectric devices that exploit sources of mechanical
						vibrations such as roadways, footsteps, raindrops, wind
						and so on.

						The amount of polarization generated and hence the potential difference generated in a piezoelectric device depends on the amount of the stress applied since they are directly proportional to each other. This is because more the tensile force you applied which is parallel to the direction of polarization, the polarization vector will extend because of increasing separation between opposite charges. Therefore, in order to generate more potential, one has to apply high stress levels. It also depends upon the piezoelectric charge constant (d). The first discovered piezo crystals such as quartz have a smaller constant value and therefore, only generate small amount of charge whereas now a days, modified Lead zirconia titanate (PZT) can generate considerably high amount of potential depending upon the type of domant that is used. Also, it depends on the structure of the PZT; for example rectangular plate or a disc ( disc has a high electromechanical coupling factor) and hence will generate more charge, or we can have single plate or a stack of PZT plates know as multilayer PZT which has a higher efficiency than the single plate.
<br><br>
Thus, there are many factors which are responsible for charge and hence potential generation in piezoelectric devices which should be taken into consideration for the final output.
