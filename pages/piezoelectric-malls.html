				Harvesting Electricity using Piezoelectric Material in Malls
			</h2>
			<p>
				The continuous use of fossil fuels has caused a depletion in
				their level and also affect the environment adversely. These
				fuels will exhaust in a few decades if their consumption
				continues with the same trend. This situation has pushed
				governmental and non-governmental organizations to find other
				non-conventional forms of energy which are sustainable and
				environmentally friendly. In recent years, harvesting
				electricity from human surroundings is being considered as one
				way to substitute conventional fuels. The use of piezoelectric
				effect for electricity production is one of the methods among
				them. This paper discusses the application of piezoelectric
				materials for electricity production in malls. For the purpose
				of this study, Muscat City Centre Mall was selected and data,
				such as number of customers who visit the mall each day, size of
				the entrance, etc., were collected. Based on the collected data,
				a model of piezoelectric slab was designed and the amount of
				electricity that can be generated was determined. In addition,
				the total cost that incurs was calculated. Although the
				implementation of the model was not found feasible only at the
				gate area, it would be possible to make the application feasible
				by extending the piezoelectric slab to a wider area and
				searching more suppliers for it at a lower cost.
