			AI has begun to enter into all aspects of life. An interesting area
			that it has bumped into is eCommerce. In times when online
			businesses are growing and there is aggressive competition amongst
			the top E-commerce players, it goes without saying that they’ll be
			out of the race if they do not keep up with the updated technology.
			<br /><br />

			<h2>How can AI be used in E-Commerce</h2>
			<h5>Conversational chatbots</h5>
			Many top names in different industries like Starbucks, Sephora,
			Domino’s have adopted chatbots to benefit their eCommerce business.
			The customer can ask any question regarding a product to a bot and
			get a prompt response. This can definitely affect the customer’s
			decision to make a purchase or not as they are given quick answers
			to their queries.
			<br /><br />

			<h5>Recommendation systems</h5>
			They are one of the easiest ways to convert AI capabilities into
			sales. This is one of the main reasons why companies have been
			investing in them since the early 2000s.
			<br /><br />

			<h5>Auto-generated product descriptions</h5>
			Customers use product descriptions to make purchase decisions. It is
			an important means to influence customers. With the help of AI
			content generation tools, eCommerce can leverage the power of AI to
			create descriptions that address the interest of the buyer.
			<br /><br />

			<h5>Image recognition</h5>
			This feature allows users to select an item from any online photo
			and use it image recognition software to identify similar items. The
			eCommerce industry can also make use of such systems to provide an
			enhanced customer experience.
			<br /><br />

			<h5>Personalized search</h5>
			Businesses can use AI-powered search engines which are also known as
			insight engines to combine search with machine learning capabilities
			so that the internal website research becomes more personalized.
