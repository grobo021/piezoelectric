			<h1>What Exactly is a Chatbot?</h1>
			A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can
			simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language
			through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the
			telephone. <br /><br />

			A chatbot is often described as one of the most advanced and
			promising expressions of interaction between humans and machines.
			However, from a technological point of view, a chatbot only
			represents the natural evolution of a Question Answering system
			leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). Formulating responses
			to questions in natural language is one of the most typical Examples
			of Natural Language Processing applied in various enterprises’
			end-use applications. <br /><br />

			<h1>How does a chatbot work?</h1>
			There are two different tasks at the core of a chatbot: <br /><br />

			<h5>User Request Analysis</h5>
			This is the first task that a chatbot performs. It analyzes the
			user’s request to <strong>identify the user intent</strong> and to
			<strong>extract relevant entities</strong>. <br /><br />

			<h5>Returning the Response</h5>
			Once the user’s intent has been identified, the chatbot must provide
			the most appropriate response for the user’s request. The answer may
			be: <br />
			<ul>
				<li>a generic predefined text</li>
				<li>
					a text retrieved from a knowledge base that contains
					different answers
				</li>
				<li>
					a contextualized piece of information based on data the user
					has provided
				</li>
				<li>data stored in enterprise systems</li>
				<li>
					the result of an action that the chatbot performed by
					interacting with one or more backend application
				</li>
				<li>
					a disambiguating question that helps the chatbot to
					correctly understand the user’s request
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />

			<h1>Why chatbots are important</h1>
			Chatbot applications streamline interactions between people and
			services, enhancing customer experience. At the same time, they
			offer companies new opportunities to improve the customers
			engagement process and operational efficiency by reducing the
			typical cost of customer service. <br /><br />

			To be successful, a chatbot solution should be able to effectively
			perform both of these tasks. Human support plays a key role here:
			Regardless of the kind of approach and the platform, human
			intervention is crucial in configuring, training and optimizing the
			chatbot system.
